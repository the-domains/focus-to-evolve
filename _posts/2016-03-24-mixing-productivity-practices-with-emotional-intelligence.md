# Mixing productivity practices with Emotional Intelligence

If you ask anyone who has ever worked with me, "what is Jason really good at 
doing".  9 out of 10 would say something similar to: "getting things done - he's 
highly productive".  I don't know what the other one would say; I'm not 
interested.

I've done this by mastering the art of designing my environments so my 
intentions and goals can be realized without distraction.  In addition, I have 
learned how to use productivity tools which give me a clear and measurable 
competitive advantage. 

This has gotten me quite far in my professional and personal life.  But now I 
want to go to another level; one that will move my noble goal forward and impact 
larger pictures.  

My next study is Emotional Intelligence (EQ).  I've studied EQ lightly for 
about 5 years having watched the TED talks and read the blogs on the subject. 
 But to take it to the next level, I have recently hired a personal EQ coach. 
 In just two months, I can already see a fundamental shift in the way I see and 
know myself, the world, my relationships, my work, and what impact I am capable 
of delivering.

People often ask me what Emotional Intelligence is and why bother with it.  I 
have never been able to articulate such a massive concept succinctly. If I'm 
forced to describe what developing Emotional Intelligence does for a person, I 
would currently say, "It allows you to become you for the first time as an 
adult".  Please watch this two minute video if you are curious what I mean:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoAFdxkyVR8][0]

I can't see into the future, but my gut is telling me that I'm in for a very 
interesting and meaningful journey as I mix my study of productivity habits and 
ways of being with the pursuit of developing my Emotional Intelligence.  

If you are interested in a similar journey of your own, I can help.  Send
