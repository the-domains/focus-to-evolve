Millions of people use Microsoft
Outlook every hour of every working day.  Of those millions, what
percentage are using it as a personal productivity tool, rather than just an
email and calendar system? How about you?

If you are working out of your
inbox all day long, then you are inflicting devastating damage on your ability
to 'get things done'.  Your work type, role and seniority do not
matter.  I've coached c-suite executives of global 500 organizations, to
office clerks and everything in between all around the world.  The
principle is the same throughout; people simply aren't using Microsoft Outlook
as it was designed to be used.

After having worked extensively
for 15 years in corporate/enterprise environments throughout the Americas,
Europe and Asia, It has become a personal mission of mine to inform people
about the damage Outlook can inflict when not used as it was designed to be
used by Bill Gates and his team.  It effects the individual and therefore
the team and therefore the organization in whole.  The blizzard is the
fault of every snowflake.  

I currently consult organizations
on business processes and proper utilization of IT to get practical and
measurable business results (in terms of dollars, time and efficiency).
Microsoft Outlook is always an easy entry point because everyone has hundreds
of emails in their inbox which is the first indicator of misuse of the
tool.  Like holding a steak knife by the wrong end.

How did you learn to use
Microsoft Outlook?  Was it from your first manager, the person sitting in
the cubicle next to you at your first job, or a friend/acquaintance early in
your career?  My point is, the chances are, you were taught early on how
to use Outlook by an individual who was entirely missing the boat.  Yup,
they knew how to use email and calendar and how to turn colors on and create
alerts and cool sounds, but the core value of the tool was not taught.
 And now your inbox has more than 20 unread emails and 347 read and
yet-to-be-processed emails sitting there; most of which will be ignored until
time renders them irrelevant.

There is a better way; and it's
simpler than you'd think.  If you are an owner of a company who pays for
licenses of MS Outlook and your team is not using the tool properly (as nearly
everyone isn't), there is massive potential for an instant productivity boost.

The best part is, the fix that I
teach is functionally and technically simple.  I do not believe in all the
bells and whistles that are offered in the Microsoft Outlook tool that all the
online Outlook courses show you. Colors, sounds, configurations, etc., although
pretty and entertaining, they are nothing but unnecessary distractions.
 If you believe otherwise, then you have a limiting belief and that belief
is damaging your productivity. 

Bottom line, once I personally
forged the habits of proper Outlook usage, I felt like I was cheating.
 Work started to feel simple no matter intensity of incoming requests and
fires.  I smiled and walked slowly to the drinking fountain observing all
the franticness (is that a word?) around me. Once (before I was running my own
little company), I was asked by a vice president of HR of a multi-billion
dollar company: "Jason, do you have enough work?  It does not seem like
it".  I smiled and said "Yes I do.  Have a nice day". 

Calm, deliberate focus enabled by
using Outlook as it was designed to be used changed my life; It can yours too.
