Aldous Huxley once wrote that humans have an insatiable appetite for distraction.  Yes, this is true; we are
genetically wired to be curious -- we do look at every ping, ding and flash that
catches our attention.  We just have to dig in!  And thank God for
that - It's why we humans are apex on the food chain (unless it's true what
Southpark said about cows).

The problem is, now we've
invented these devices with software that constantly ping and ding... forcing us
(or so we falsely believe) to multitask -- jump from thing to thing to thing
throughout a day almost without our own consent.

Here's the problem. 
Multitasking requires you to hold a lot of information in your working memory,
which is controlled by a part of the brain known as the  prefrontal cortex
(PFC).

The  PFC  is also 
responsible for  willpower, and  for  keeping fear and anxiety
in  check.

Multitasking increases the
"cognitive load" on the PFC, overwhelming it and effectively killing its
ability to hold strong willpower and keep fear/anxiety at  bay (the
feeling of being overwhelmed).

By the way, what we typically
refer to as "multitasking" is not multitasking.  Very few humans can
actually churn two thought processes in their PFC simultaneously.  If you
are in that 1% minority, chances are you've already been tapped on the shoulder
to become a fighter pilot -- the government heavily recruits these rare people
for this role.  All you are really doing is jumping from thought process
to thought process which places heavy taxes on a clearly finite resource of
cognitive energy (regardless of how many cups of Starbucks you chug).

So think of  it  this
way...  "Multitasking", physical pain, emotional pain, busy-life times,
crowded days, and clutter in general of any kind all diminish one's 
ability for maintaining willpower.  The more you have going on at the same
time, the less your willpower. 

Calm and single-point focus on
one item at a time (task/project/problem) literally increases your
willpower.  Why not take advantage of that?

Turn off the pings, dings,
reminders and hide the incessant email inbox when you work. 

Calmly focus on one thing at a
time to get more done; it works.  And the best part is, it's a choice.
